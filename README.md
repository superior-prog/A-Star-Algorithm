# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

This search algorithm was first published the algorithm in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). It can be seen as an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's 1959 algorithm.

A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.). It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied.
